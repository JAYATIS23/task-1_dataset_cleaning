Summary of cleaning performed on Mall_Customers.csv

Files produced:
- cleaned_dataset.csv (cleaned output)
- cleaning_script.py (standalone script to reproduce cleaning)
- README.md (instructions)
- summary_of_changes.txt (this file)

Key actions performed:
1. Renamed columns to lowercase with underscores for consistency.
2. Removed exact duplicate rows (if any).
3. Standardized 'gender' values to 'Male' / 'Female' and cleaned missing entries.
4. Converted 'age', 'annual_income_(k$)', and 'spending_score_(1-100)' to numeric types.
5. Filled missing numeric values with the column median and converted to integer.
6. Reordered columns to: customerid, gender, age, annual_income_(k$), spending_score_(1-100).

Notes / assumptions:
- The dataset did not contain date columns; no date parsing was required.
- Median imputation was chosen as a simple robust strategy for any missing numeric values.
- Any non-standard gender entries were normalized to 'Male' or 'Female'; ambiguous entries become missing (NA).
- The cleaning script is deterministic and reproducible; run `python3 cleaning_script.py` in the directory with Mall_Customers.csv.
